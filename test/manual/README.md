# Grimoire Manual Test Rig

A hands-on harness for exercising `grim` against real local OCI registries
with a committed sample catalog of skills, rules, and agents. This is **fully
separate** from the pytest acceptance suite (`test/tests/`): it runs its
own `registry:2` containers on **`localhost:5050`** (the primary `grimoire`
catalog) and **`localhost:5051`** (a small `tools` subset for the
multi-registry demo), each with its own container + volume, while the suite
uses `localhost:5000`. They are isolated on purpose — sharing one registry
let the suite's hundreds of throwaway `grim-test/<uuid>` repos bleed into
`grim search` / `grim tui` here as junk. It exists so you can drive the tool
by hand and see how it behaves.

Pattern mirrors the OCX manual rig: committed source-of-truth catalog,
idempotent `bootstrap.sh`, an isolated `GRIM_HOME`, a ready-made consumer
project, and a `teardown.sh`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `catalog/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Source-of-truth sample skills (committed) |
| `catalog/rules/<name>.md` | Source-of-truth sample rules (committed) |
| `catalog/agents/<name>.md` | Source-of-truth sample agents (committed) |
| `catalog/bundles/starter-pack.toml` | Bundle v1 member set (committed) |
| `catalog/bundles/starter-pack-v2.toml` | Bundle v2 member set — adds + removes members (committed) |
| `catalog/bundles/review-pack.toml` | Bundle sharing `code-reviewer` with starter-pack + an agent member (committed) |
| `project/grimoire.toml` | Ready-made single-registry consumer project (floating `:1` tags) |
| `project-multi/grimoire.toml` | Multi-registry consumer project (`[[registries]]` aliases across 5050 + 5051) |
| `scripts/env.sh` | `source` it to point `grim` at the rig |
| `scripts/bootstrap.sh` | Build `grim`, start both registries, publish the version matrix + multi-registry subset |
| `scripts/release-update.sh` | Publish `code-reviewer` 1.3.0 (post-lock outdated / rolling-release demo) |
| `scripts/teardown.sh` | Wipe rig state (`--registry` also stops both registries) |
| `docker-compose.yml` | `registry:2` on `localhost:5050` (primary) and `localhost:5051` (`tools` subset) |
| `.grim-home/` | Isolated `GRIM_HOME` (gitignored, ephemeral) |

## Quick start

```sh
test/manual/scripts/bootstrap.sh        # one command: build + registry + publish
source test/manual/scripts/env.sh       # point `grim` at the rig
```

Published catalog (a small **version matrix** — most artifacts ship one
1.0.0, a few carry extra versions for the upgrade / `↑ outdated` demos):

| Kind | Repo | Versions |
|------|------|----------|
| skill | `localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/hello-world` | 1.0.0 |
| skill | `localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/code-reviewer` | 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0 (1.3.0 via `release-update.sh`) |
| skill | `localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/commit-helper` | 1.0.0, 2.0.0 |
| skill | `localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/architecture-guide` | 1.0.0 |
| skill | `localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/old-reviewer` | 1.0.0 (deprecated — drives the deprecation surface) |
| rule | `localhost:5050/grimoire/rules/rust-style` | 1.0.0, 1.1.0 |
| rule | `localhost:5050/grimoire/rules/security-baseline` | 1.0.0 |
| rule | `localhost:5050/grimoire/rules/architecture-guide` | 1.0.0 |
| agent | `localhost:5050/grimoire/agents/reviewer` | 1.0.0, 1.1.0 |
| agent | `localhost:5050/grimoire/agents/release-bot` | 1.0.0 (vendor-override demo) |
| bundle | `localhost:5050/grimoire/bundles/starter-pack` | 1.0.0, 2.0.0 (v2 adds commit-helper, drops security-baseline) |
| bundle | `localhost:5050/grimoire/bundles/review-pack` | 1.0.0 (shares code-reviewer with starter-pack, adds the reviewer agent) |

Each full-semver release cascades the floating tags forward, e.g. `1.0.0`
also sets `1.0`, `1`, `latest`; publishing `code-reviewer` `1.2.0` then
moves `1.2`, `1`, `latest` onto it. Because of this, `bootstrap.sh`
publishes versions in **ascending** order per artifact, so the floating
`:1`/`:latest` the consumer project pins always land on the highest
version (code-reviewer `1.2.0`, commit-helper `2.0.0`, rust-style `1.1.0`).

It also publishes a small **second-registry subset** at `1.0.0` for the
multi-registry demo (see scenario 2a):

| Kind | Repo | Versions |
|------|------|----------|
| skill | `localhost:5051/tools/skills/commit-helper` | 1.0.0 |
| rule | `localhost:5051/tools/rules/security-baseline` | 1.0.0 |

## Scenarios

### 1. Browse the catalog

```sh
grim search                       # whole catalog
grim search review                # filter by keyword/description
grim search --format json
grim tui                          # interactive (requires a TTY)
```

### 1a. TUI: multi-select, batch, scope, delete

`grim tui` (needs a TTY). Each row shows a colored state glyph:
`✓ installed` (green), `↑ outdated` (yellow), `✱ modified` (red),
`✘ integrity-missing` (magenta — recorded but files gone/edited away),
`· not-installed` (grey).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` | move selection (scroll the detail pane while it is open) |
| `pgup`/`pgdn` | scroll the detail pane from any mode (no focus needed) |
| `t` | toggle between tree view and flat list view |
| `→` | expand the selected group in tree view |
| `←` | collapse the selected group in tree view |
| `Enter` on group | fold/unfold group (on a leaf: open detail pane) |
| `space` | mark/unmark the selected row; on a group: mark all descendant leaves |
| `a` / `c` | mark all visible / clear marks |
| `i` / `u` / `d` | install / update / **uninstall** the marked set (or the selection if nothing marked); on a group with no marks: acts on the whole subtree |
| `o` | open the selected entry's repository URL in the browser |
| `g` | toggle scope (project ⇄ global) — title shows the active scope |
| `/` | search; `enter` browse detail (`j`/`k` also scroll there); `r` refresh catalog; `q` quit |

Try: mark a couple with `space`, press `i` (batch install), watch the
state glyphs flip to green; `d` to batch-uninstall; `g` to see the same
catalog against the global scope's state. Tamper a file
(`echo x >> test/manual/project/.claude/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md`)
then refresh — it shows `✱ modified`; delete the dir and it shows
`✘ integrity-missing`.

The detail pane (`enter`) shows the centered identifier, a `Summary:` /
`Description:` section, and a `Metadata:` block (version + status stay on
the catalog row). Most rig artifacts carry an authored `repository` URL
(`https://github.com/grimoire-samples/…`, emitted as the
`org.opencontainers.image.source` annotation) — `o` opens it.
`hello-world` and `security-baseline` intentionally carry none, so they
demo the `Repository: -` fallback and the "no repository URL for this
entry" status line. The `architecture-guide` **skill** ships a
deliberately long description so its pane overflows a small terminal —
open it and scroll (`↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k`), or page it from the list with
`pgup`/`pgdn` without opening it at all.

**Tree view walkthrough**: press `t` to switch from the flat list to tree
mode. The registry host (`localhost:5050`) becomes the root node and is
elided from display because exactly one registry resolves (single-registry
scope); children group by path segment (`grimoire/skills`, `grimoire/rules`, etc.). Press
`→` on a group to expand it, `←` to collapse, `Enter` to toggle.
Try `space` on the `grimoire/skills` group — every descendant leaf gets
marked; the group glyph turns filled. Press `i` to batch-install the whole
subtree. Press `t` again to return to the flat list — marks survive the
toggle. Add `tree_separators = ["/", "-"]` to `test/manual/project/grimoire.toml`
under `[options.tui]` to see `code-reviewer` and `commit-helper` split
further at the hyphen.

### 1b. Deprecated package highlight (issue #15)

`old-reviewer` ships `metadata.deprecated`, published as the
`com.grimoire.deprecated` annotation. The notice surfaces on all three
discovery/acquisition paths:

```sh
grim search old-reviewer                  # plain: Status cell reads "...,deprecated"
grim search old-reviewer --format json    # JSON: a "deprecated" field carries the message
grim tui                                   # yellow "⚠ deprecated" after the status label in the Status column; detail pane (enter) shows Deprecated:
```

Acquiring the reference warns on stderr (the add still succeeds):

```sh
cd test/manual/project
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/old-reviewer:1
# stderr: "...old-reviewer:1 is deprecated: superseded by code-reviewer — migrate before the next release"
```

A current package (e.g. `code-reviewer`) carries no marker, a `null`
`deprecated` JSON field, and warns on neither search nor add — the contrast
is the point.

### 2. Lock & install into a client

```sh
cd test/manual/project
grim lock                         # floating :1 -> pinned @sha256
cat grimoire.lock                 # byte-stable, digest-pinned
grim install                      # targets the detected clients (all when none detected)
ls -R .claude/skills .claude/rules .claude/agents
grim status                       # every artifact 'installed'
```

### 2a. Multi-registry: browse-all + `[[registries]]` alias resolution

`bootstrap.sh` publishes the primary catalog to `localhost:5050/grimoire`
and a small `tools` subset (`commit-helper`, `security-baseline`) to a
SECOND registry `localhost:5051/tools`. The `project-multi/` consumer
declares both with `[[registries]]`, so one search browses both and
fully-qualified refs across the two hosts lock and install together.
`GRIM_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` (set by `env.sh`) is the short-id default only —
it does not collapse the browse; only `--registry` does.

```sh
cd test/manual/project-multi
cat grimoire.toml                 # two [[registries]]: primary (5050), tools (5051)

grim search                       # browses BOTH 5050/grimoire AND 5051/tools
grim search commit-helper         # the 5051/tools copy surfaces here too

grim lock                         # pins each FQ ref to its own registry
grep -E 'pinned' grimoire.lock    # hello-world @5050; commit-helper,
                                  #   security-baseline @5051
grim install && grim status       # all 'installed' from across both registries
```

Alias resolution is a `grim add` CLI convenience (the leading segment is the
alias, the rest is appended to its `url`), not a persisted config form:

```sh
# 'tools' -> localhost:5051/tools, so this resolves to
#   localhost:5051/tools/skills/commit-helper:1
grim add tools/skills/commit-helper:1
```

### 2b. Multi-registry TUI: registry-tree projection

The TUI browses every declared `[[registries]]` in one session, grouping by
registry. With `env.sh` sourced (`GRIM_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` set), both roots
still appear — the env var does not collapse the browse. Run it from the
multi-registry project (needs a TTY):

```sh
cd test/manual/project-multi
grim tui                          # interactive only — the TUI needs a real TTY
```

Verify (each maps to a design decision — see the plan / ADR):

- **Two registry roots, not elided** (D-ELIDE): with two registries resolved,
  neither host is elided — the tree shows BOTH `localhost:5050/grimoire` and
  `localhost:5051/tools` as top-level roots. (Elision only kicks in when
  *exactly one* registry resolves — that is the single-registry walkthrough in
  scenario 1a, where the lone root is hidden.)
- **Precedence order, not alphabetical** (F13): the `default = true` primary
  (`localhost:5050/grimoire`) sorts FIRST, `tools` (`localhost:5051/tools`)
  second — declaration/resolution order. Deeper levels stay alphabetical.
- **Namespaced roots stay distinct** (D-TREE): the roots are the full
  `host/namespace` (`…:5050/grimoire`, `…:5051/tools`), never collapsed under a
  bare `localhost`. `commit-helper` appears under BOTH roots — one copy per
  registry.
- **Cross-registry batch**: expand both roots, `space` on each registry group to
  mark all descendants, `i` to install — each package installs to its own
  registry and the glyphs flip green under both roots.
- **Empty / offline registry still shows as a root** (D-EMPTY + D-DEGRADE):
  stop the second registry (`docker stop grim-manual-registry-2`, or
  `docker compose -f test/manual/docker-compose.yml stop registry-2`), then `r`
  to refresh — the `tools` root still renders (as a `0/0` root) and the status
  line reports `offline: localhost:5051/tools`. Restart the container + `r` to
  restore it.
- **Status line clears after refresh** (regression guard): press `r`; once the
  reload finishes the transient `refreshing catalog…` message must CLEAR — it
  must not stay stuck. With everything healthy the status falls through to the
  health line (empty) or the marked-count hint.
- **Scope toggle re-elides** (D-ELIDE on `g`): press `g` to switch scope. A
  scope that declares a single registry re-elides its root; a scope with
  multiple registries keeps every root. The root set updates live.
- **Namespaced bundle members resolve correctly** (B1c): expand a bundle that
  lives in a namespaced registry — its members show their true install state
  (e.g. `✓`/`via bundle`), not a stale `· not-installed`. They are matched
  against the full `host/namespace`, never a first-`/` split to bare `localhost`.
- **Flat list shows Registry column** (feature A): press `t` to switch to flat
  view. With two registries resolved the table gains a leading **Registry** column
  showing each row's registry display label (alias or URL) and the Repo cell
  shortens to the registry-relative path. Switch back to single-registry project
  and verify the column is absent (single-registry elision unchanged).
- **Alias-based labels in tree roots and health line** (feature B): set
  `alias = "tools"` on the `localhost:5051/tools` entry in
  `test/manual/project-multi/grimoire.toml`, then `r` to refresh. The
  `localhost:5051/tools` tree root must now read `tools (localhost:5051/tools)`.
  Take the second registry offline — the status line must say `offline: tools
  (localhost:5051/tools)` instead of the raw URL.

### 3. Multi-client transform (Copilot rule transform)

```sh
grim install --client claude,copilot
cat .github/instructions/rust-style.instructions.md
# note: `paths:` frontmatter stripped + provenance header prepended
```

### 4. Integrity protection

```sh
echo "tampered" >> .claude/skills/hello-world/SKILL.md
grim status                       # hello-world -> 'modified'
grim install                      # refused (exit 65) — local edit protected
grim install --force              # overwrite the local edit
```

### 5. Rolling release / outdated / update

`bootstrap.sh` publishes `code-reviewer` ascending to 1.2.0, so locking the
floating `:1` records 1.2.0 (state `installed`, NOT `outdated`). To produce
a genuine `↑ outdated` lock, publish a version ABOVE the matrix top AFTER
locking — that is exactly what `release-update.sh` does (1.3.0):

```sh
# in test/manual/project, after `grim lock` (code-reviewer pinned at 1.2.0):
grep code-reviewer grimoire.lock          # 1.2.0 digest
../scripts/release-update.sh              # publishes code-reviewer 1.3.0, moves :1
grim status                               # code-reviewer -> 'outdated'
grim update                               # re-resolves :1 -> 1.3.0
grep code-reviewer grimoire.lock          # digest advanced
grim status                               # back to 'installed'
```

### 5a. Bundle add/remove on upgrade

The `starter-pack` bundle ships two versions with different member sets, so
upgrading `:1 -> :2` adds AND removes members:

```sh
# v1: code-reviewer + rust-style + security-baseline
# `add` infers kind=bundle from the published manifest's artifactType
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/bundles/starter-pack:1
cat grimoire.toml grimoire.lock           # inspect the resolved members

# v2 ADDS commit-helper, DROPS security-baseline
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/bundles/starter-pack:2
grim update                               # commit-helper added, security-baseline pruned
cat grimoire.toml grimoire.lock
```

### 5b. Shared bundle members

`starter-pack` and `review-pack` both declare `code-reviewer` at the same
identifier, so declaring both coalesces it to ONE lock entry that records
BOTH bundles as provenance. Removing one bundle strips only that bundle's
provenance entry — the member survives until the last holder goes.

Run this in a **scratch project**: the rig's ready-made project declares
every bundle member directly, and a direct declaration always wins over
bundle provenance (you would see `direct`, not `bundle: …`).

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/grim-shared-demo && cd /tmp/grim-shared-demo
grim init
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/bundles/starter-pack:1
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/bundles/review-pack:1
grim status                       # code-reviewer source: "bundle: ...starter-pack, ...review-pack"
grep -B3 -A3 'skill.bundles' grimoire.lock    # multi-provenance [[skill.bundles]] rows

grim remove bundle review-pack
grim status                       # code-reviewer still locked (held by starter-pack)
grim remove bundle starter-pack
grim status                       # now gone — the last holder was removed
```

The same holds in the TUI: deleting one of the two bundle rows keeps the
shared member's files on disk; only members the deleted bundle exclusively
owns are uninstalled.

### 5c. Agents (per-client rendering + vendor overrides)

The project declares the `reviewer` agent; `release-bot` carries
vendor-namespaced metadata (`claude.model: opus`,
`claude.permission-mode: plan`, `opencode.temperature: "0.2"`) that
overrides or extends the projected common fields per client:

```sh
cd test/manual/project
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/agents/release-bot:1
grim install --client claude,opencode,copilot

cat .claude/agents/release-bot.md     # claude.model override: model: opus (+ permissionMode)
cat .opencode/agents/release-bot.md   # common model: sonnet kept; temperature lifted; no name:
cat .github/agents/release-bot.md     # tools: as a YAML list; no model
cat .claude/agents/reviewer.md        # common fields only -> installed verbatim
```

### 6. add / remove

```sh
grim add localhost:5050/grimoire/skills/hello-world:1
grim remove skill commit-helper
cat grimoire.toml grimoire.lock
```

### 7. Global scope

```sh
grim --global init
grim --global add localhost:5050/grimoire/rules/security-baseline:1
grim --global install
```

### 8. Offline behavior

```sh
GRIM_OFFLINE=1 grim search        # serves cached catalog, exit 0
GRIM_OFFLINE=1 grim install       # warm blob cache succeeds; cold -> exit 81
```

## Teardown

```sh
test/manual/scripts/teardown.sh             # wipe rig state, keep registry
test/manual/scripts/teardown.sh --registry  # also stop + remove the registry
```

Re-run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` any time to recreate from the committed catalog.
